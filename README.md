# crochet-store

An e-commerce website built for a friend's small business that sells handmade crochet products. 

## How It's Made

**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.

## Skills Learned

This was my very first project using React. I gained hands-on experience with:
- Creating and organizing React components  
- Using props to avoid repeating code for each product
- Using React Router for a multi-page website
- Managing state to update values dynamically in the app
- Applying HTML and CSS (Flexbox) to design an interactive and user-friendly interface
